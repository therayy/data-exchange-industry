# Install [IBM Connect:Direct](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/connect-direct/6.1.0?topic=connectdirect-v610-pdfs)

   > _This recipe is for deploying the IBM Connect Direct on Red Hat Enterprise Linux assuiming you already got your system subsription done & hostname was define as icc.sterling.com_.

### Section A: [Pre-Cofiguration](./CD.md)
<details>
    <summary> Create a usename & move files using that user name into /home/username/ibm directory & chmod of all scripts </summary>

1.  Adding new user:
``` bash
useradd cdadmin # If does not exist
passwd cdadmin #set your password
```
2. Copy over all files into `ibm` folder
```bash
mkdir /home/cdadmin/ibm
```
3. Give permission to run all scripts
```bash
cd /home/cdadmin/ibm
chmod +x ./*
```
4. In this case I extracted the C:D installation tar and renamed it `cd` into that ../ibm directory
5. Grab your IP and set your hostname& turn off firewall
```bash
hostnamectl set-hostname cd.sterling.com
```
```bash
export ip=$(ifconfig | grep 'inet ' | grep -v '127.0.0.1' | head -n 1 | awk '{print $2}')
echo $ip
```
```bash
vi /etc/hosts # update the 2nd line wiht your IP and Hostname
```
```bash
su - root
systemctl disable firewalld
```

6. Run `./cdinstall`
