### Section A: [Pre-Cofiguration](./CD.md)
<details>
    <summary> Create a usename & move files using that user name into /home/username/ibm directory & chmod of all scripts </summary>

1.  Adding new user:
``` bash
useradd cdadmin
passwd cdadmin #set your password
```
2. Copy over all files into `ibm` folder
```bash
mkdir /home/cdadmin/ibm
```
3. Give permission to run all scripts
```bash
cd /home/cdadmin/ibm
chmod +x ./*
```
4. In this case I extracted the C:D installation tar and renamed it `cd` into that ../ibm directory
 
5. Run `./cdinstall`
