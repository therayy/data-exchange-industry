### Senario A: 
**`proxy.attempt=N`**
, The Remote ID has both a Functional Authority and Proxy record on your C:D node. 
ðŸ”— Your C:D node will attempt to validate the incoming ID with the Functional Authority record. If this fails, the process fails. ~~C:D will not try the Proxy record.~~ 

### Senario B: 
**`proxy.attempt=N`**
, The Remote ID has only a Proxy record on your C:D node. 
ðŸ”— Your C:D node will first look in Functional Authorities for the incoming ID and ~~will not find a record for the incoming ID~~
- C:D will then look in Proxies for a record. Finding it
- C:D will map the process to the `LocalUserid` specified in the Proxy record.
- C:D will then attempt to validate the LocalUserid in the Functional Authorities records. If this validation for the LocalUserid fails, the process fails.

### Senario C: 
**`proxy.attempt=Y`**
, The Remote ID has only a Proxy record on your C:D node.
ðŸ”— Your C:D node will first look in Functional Authorities for the incoming ID and ~~will not find a record for the incoming ID~~
- C:D will then look in Proxies for a record. Finding it
- C:D will map the process to the `LocalUserid` specified in the Proxy record.
- C:D will then attempt to validate the LocalUserid in the Functional Authorities records. If this validation for the LocalUserid fails, the process fails.
